\chapter{Introduction}
		Sudoku is a simple logic game, in the standard $9 \times 9$ (or $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$) one must complete the grid such that every row, column and box contains the numbers 1 to 9, that is all, yet it is filled with mathematics. Through sudoku we can explore the connections between various areas of maths: complexity theory, graph theory, group theory and information theory.

\chapter{Sudoku is Hard}

Let's imagine a sudoku of size $D^2\times D^2$. How big does $D$ have to be for you to need more than a day to solve it? Maybe 6 or 10 or even just 4. Don't worry if you said a smaller number than your friends, this has nothing to do with your problem solving skills, even a computer finds sudoku hard. In fact just incrementing $D$ by 1 leads to an exponential increase in compute time and the most optimal algorithms for solving sudoku are infeasible for $100 \times 100$.

We prove sudoku's hardness by transforming it into a known 'difficult' problem; we will use SAT, a problem that has plagued computer scientists for decades. 

\section{Computational Complexity}

For those with a mathematical mind, outraged by the lack of definitions for 'difficulty' and 'hardness', let's take a detour into complexity theory. 

\textbf{Def$^\text{n}$:} Let $f$ be a function indicating the execution time for an algorithm and $g$ a strictly positive function. $f(x)=O (g(x))$ if $\exists$ positive $ M$ and $x_0$ such that $|f(x)|\leq Mg(x)$ $\forall$ $x\geq x_0$. This is coined \textbf{Big O Notation}.

Example of a linear time algorithm. Given a sudoku board and a square to check it takes a linear amount of time to validate this.
Example of a polynomial time algorithm, checking a whole sudoku board is polynomial.
Example of an exponential time algorithm. Brute Force Alg?


\textbf{Def$^\text{n}$:} A \textbf{Reduction}, $A \leq_p B$, is a transformation in polynomial time ($O(x^c)$) from problem $A$ to $B$.
	
\textbf{Def$^\text{n}$:} A \textbf{Turing Machine} is the mathematical model of a CPU.

\textbf{Def$^\text{n}$:} A \textbf{non-deterministic} Turing Machine is the mathematical model of a CPU that can undertake any possible action all at once, for example with a sudoku it would be able to explore solutions with a cell taking all values 1 to $n^2$ all at once.

\textbf{Sets of Difficulty:} 
We care about decision problems, these are problems that given an input  produce a 'yes' or 'no' answer. We will discuss three sets of these problems: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{P is the the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time (if the input is order n then the program halts in order $n^2$ steps) by a Turing machine;} 
	\item{NP is the class of problems that can be verified in polynomial time and solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine;} 
	\item{the NP-complete set has problems that any NP problem can be reduced to in polynomial time.} 
\end{itemize}

Problems in P are considered feasible and those in NP-complete are infeasible as their complexity scales exponentially with respect to the input size and as it is assumed they cannot be solved in polynomial time ($P \neq NP$) and are therefore infeesible for large inputs. \footnote{We can only assume that $P\neq NP$ as this problem is yet to be proven, it is in fact one of the Millennium Prize problems.}

So when we state sudoku is hard we are actually saying sudoku belongs to NP-complete. We cannot just prove sudoku belongs to NP as this also includes problems in P. \footnote{Due to Ladner's Theorem there exists problem $\in$ NP but $\not\in$ NP-complete and $\not\in$ P iff $P\neq NP$.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=60mm]{P_np.svg}
	\end{center}
	\caption{P, NP, NP-complete \& NP-hard sets \cite{P_NP_Figure}}
\end{figure}

\textbf{How to prove NP completeness generally?}
Call the problem we wish to prove is NP-complete $x$. First show there exists a verifier for $x$ with a polynomial or less runtime, this is a algorithm that decides if a proposed solution to problem $x$ is correct. Then take a known NP-complete problem call this $y$, and reduce it to $x$, one does this by transforming the input of $y$ to the input of $x$ in polynomial time, we call this function $g(y)=x$. Assume there exists a polynomial time algorithm to solve $x$, $f()$ we could solve $y$ in polynomial time too, $f(g(y))$, this implies P=NP, a contradiction. Therefore a polynomial time algorithm does not exist for $x$.

\textbf{Our base NP-complete problem.} If, as the above suggests, we require a NP-complete problem to prove a problem is NP-complete then we seem to have reached a paradox. Luckily we have the Cook-Levin Theorem.

\textit{Cook-Levin Theorem:} SAT is NP-Complete \textit{CITE }

\textbf{Def$^n$}: SAT is the following decision problem. Given a set of boolean variables $B$ and a collection of clauses $C$ does a valid truth assignment exist that satisfies $C$?

We now have a NP-complete problem to reduce other problems to.

\textbf{Let's make this more intuitive with examples.} 

\section{Verification is Easy}
Verificaiton decision problem, "is the sudoku puzzle complete?":

		\begin{equation}
			\Psi(S(,)) = \begin{cases}	
				\text{True if the puzzle is complete} \\
				\text{False if the puzzle is not complete}.
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation}

There exists an algorithm to do this in polynomial time with respect to the dimensions of the grid. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each row in the grid check there exists no repeated numbers. $O(n^2)$
\item For each column in the grid check there exists no repeated numbers. $O(n^2)$
\item For each box in the grid check there exists no repeated numbers. $O(n^2)$
\end{enumerate}
If all tests pass return True else return False.
This algorithm has complexity of $O(n^2 + n^2 + n^2) = O(3n^2) = O(n^2)$, this is polynomial and therefore $\Psi(S(,)) \in P$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


	\section{Existance is Hard}
		
Checking if a solution to sudoku exists is NP-complete, let us define the decision problem:

		\begin{equation}
		        \Phi (S(,)) = \begin{cases}
		            \text{True if a completion exists} \\
		            \text{False if a completion does not exist}.
				\end{cases}
		\end{equation}

Our question is does there exist a function $\Phi$ that when given an instance of the problem will, in polynomial time or less, return True if it can be solved and False otherwise.

\subsection{Proof Outline}

The verifier is $O(n^2)$, as will be seen in the above subsection 'Validation is Easy', this shows the Sudoku decision problem belongs to the set NP.

Now we need a reduction from sudoku to a known NP-complete problem to prove sudoku is also NP-hard. We will be creating a chain of reductions: \textbf{Sudoku $\geq_p$  Latin Square $\geq_p$  Triangulated Tripartite $\geq_p$  3SAT $\geq_p$ SAT}.

As the Sudoku decision problem is a member of NP and NP-hard it is NP-complete by definition.

\textbf{Note}: Theoretically any problem in the set NP-complete can be reduced to Sudoku and therefore this reduction is not unique, however, it is the most intuitive way. Some readers may question why we are not looking at a reduction to a Graph $n^2$-Colouring problem but in section \textbf{cite} we explore this is the wrong direction of reduction.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{Sudoku $\geq_p$ Latin Square}

\textbf{Def$^n$}: A valid Latin Square puzzle is a function $L:i,j \rightarrow x$ for values $i,j \in \{1,..,D\} $ and $x \in \{0,...,D\}$ satisfying the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{for all $a,b,c \in \{1,...,D\}$ with $L(a,b) \neq 0 $ and $L(a,c) \neq 0$ then $L(a,b) \neq L(a,c)$}
\item{for all $a,b,c \in \{1,...,D\}$ with $L(a,b) \neq 0 $ and $L(c,b) \neq 0$ then $L(a,b) \neq L(c,b)$}
\end{itemize}
It is complete or solved if for all $i,j \in \{1,...,D\}$, $L(i,j) \neq 0$.

By observation we see this is a superset of the sudoku puzzle, we just add the restrictions that the dimension must be a square number and also add the third property of the sudoku puzzle defintion.

\textit{What is the Latin Square decision problem?} Given a latin square puzzle $L(,)$, can the function be augmented, by changing only the value of the function for value pairs $i,j$ that previously gave $L(i,j) =0$, to get a complete latin square puzzle?


\textit{Proof idea:} We must reduce a given latin square grid of size $D \times D$ to a sudoku grid size $D^2 \times D^2$ that is solvable iff the Latin square is. 

\textbf{Lemma:} Let $S_l$ be a Sudoku problem with the following construction 
\begin{equation}
	S_l(i,j) =\begin{cases}
0 \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{when } (i,j) \in L_s \\ 
((i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1)\text{ mod } n^2 +1 \quad\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $L_s=\{(i,j)| \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor=0 \text{ and }(j \text{ mod }n)=1\}$. Then  there exists an augmentation $S_l'$ to complete the sudoku puzzle if and only if the square $L$ such that $L(i,j/n)=S_l'(i,j)-1/n+1$ for all $(i,j) \in L_s$ is a Latin square.

\textbf{Note:} The fact we have a formula to generate a valid sudoku for any size $D^2$ is interesting and we should explore if this can be done for a $M\times N$ sudoku too. (explored in section 3).
Figure \ref{formula} gives examples of generated sudokus from this formula.

\caption{Formula Generation of Valid Sudoku}
\label{formula}
\end{figure}

\textit{Proof:}

First we must show $S_l(i,j)=((i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1)\text{ mod } n^2 +1$ forms a complete and valid sudoku puzzle.

When $i=[1,...,n^2]$ then:
\begin{align}
	0&<\left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor<n-1\\
	0&<i-1 \text{ mod } n<n-1\\
	0&<(i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor<n^2-n\\
	0&<(i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1<n^2-1\\
	1&<((i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1)\text{ mod } n^2 +1<n^2\\
	1&<S_l(i,j)<n^2
\end{align} 
Note $\left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor$ gives the row coordinate when indexed at 0 in which the larger box that (i,j) belongs to starts and $i-1 \text{ mod } n$ gives the row within that box when indexed at 0. Therefore $(\left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor,i-1 \text{ mod } n)$ will take all value pairs of integers between 0 and $n-1$.

When j is fixed (particular column), assume two cells have the same value, that is $S_l(i,j)=S_l(i',j)$ then
\begin{align}
	(i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1 &= (i'-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i'-1/n}\right\rfloor+j-1\\
	(i-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor &= (i'-1 \text{ mod } n)n + \left\lfloor{i'-1/n}\right\rfloor
\end{align}
from the above $i=i'$. No cell on a column has the same value.

When i is fixed (particular column) assume two cells have the same value, that is $S_l(i,j)=S_l(i,j')$ implies $j-1=j'-1 (mod n)$ therefore $j=j'$.

For the third condition fix $\left\lfloor{i-1/n}\right\rfloor$. (i-1 \text{ mod } n,j) takes all value pairs of integers 0 to n-1 so if a cell has the same value as another within the n by n square $S_l(i,j)=S_l(i',j')$ implying $(i-1 \text{ mod } n,j)=(i'-1 \text{ mod } n,j')$ which means $i=i'$ and $j=j'$. Therefore $S_l$ is a valid and complete sudoku puzzle.

Now consider which integers fill the blanks in $L_s$. For $(i,j)\in L_s$, $S_l(i,j)-1= ((i-1 \text{ mod } n)n+j-1)\text{ mod } n^2$ as $j mod n=1$, $j-1modn=0$ therfore $S_l(i,j)-1$ is divisible by n so $S_l-1/n+1$ gives integers between $[1,...,n]$. Therefore $L(i,j) \in [0,...,n]$.

We must validate the Latin square conditions. The row constraint in $S_l$ ensures $S'(i,j)=S'(i,j') \implies j=j'$, $S'(i,j)-1/n+1=S'(i,j')-1/n+1 \implies j=j'$, $L(i,j/n)=S'(i,j'/n) \implies j=j'$  is equivalent to the row constraint of L. The column constraint of $S_l$ is equivalent to the column constraint of L. The small square constraint of $S_l$ is equivalent to the column constraint of L. $\square$

\subsection{Latin Square $\geq_p$ Triangulate A Tripartite Graph}

\textbf{Def$^n$}: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is tripartite if a partition $V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$ exists such that the vertices are split into three sets with no edges between vertices that belong to the same set, i.e for all $(v_i,v_j) \in E\text{ if } v_i \in V_i\text{ then }v_j \not\in V_i $.

\textbf{Def$^n$:} A triangulation T of a graph is a way to divide edges into disjoint subsets $T_i$, each forming a triangle ($T_i=\{(v_{1}, v_{2}),(v_{2}, v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{1})\}$).

If a tripartite graph can be triangulated it must be uniform, that is: every vertex in $V_1$ (or $V_2$ or $V_3$) has the same number of neighbour in $V_2$ and $V_3$ (or the respective sets).

\textit{What is the Triangulated Tripartite decision problem?} Given a graph G that is tripartite (can be split into 3 subgroup, within these subgroups vertices should not share edges) can it be triangulated ?

\textbf{Theorem:} Completing a Latin square with dimensions n by n is equivalent to triangulating a tripartite graph $G= V_1, V_2, V_3$.

\textit{Proof:} 

Intuitively, we map a graph to a Latin square $L$ through the following: 
given tripartite graph G=(V,E) label vertices in $V_1$ with distinct lables $\{r_1,...r_n\}$, label vertices in $V_2$ with distinct lables $\{c_1,...c_n\}$ and label vertices in $V_3$ with distinct lables $\{e_1,...e_n\}$. Add edges such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item{If $L(i,j) = 0$ then add the edge $(r_i,c_j)$ }
\item{If for all $i \in [0,...,n]$ and constant j, $L(i,j) \neq k$ then add the edge $(r_i,e_k)$}
\item{If for all $j \in [0,...,n]$ and constant i, $L(i,j) \neq k$ then add the edge $(c_j,e_k)$}
\end{itemize}
This graph has a triangulation iff $L(i,j)$ can be solved.

\textbf{EXAMPLE}

Let us show every uniform tripartite graph can be transformed to the above formulation of a Latin square.

First we need an intermediate that is a generalisation of a latin square

\textbf{Def$^n$}: A Latin framework LF for tripartite graph G, size (r,s,t) is a r by s array with values [1,...,t]. With constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Each row/column contain each element only once.}
\item{If $(r_i,c_j)\in E$ then LF(i,j)=0 else LF(i,j)= k, $k\in [1,...,t]$}
\item{If $(r_i,e_k)\in E$  then $\forall j$ $LF(i,j)\neq k$}
\item{If $(c_j,e_k)\in E$  then $\forall i$ $LF(i,j)\neq k$}
\end{itemize}
If r=s=t then LF is a latin square (formulation above) which can be completed iff G has a triangle partition.

\textbf{Lemma}: For tripartite graph G=(V,E) with $|V_1|=|V_2|=|V_3|=n$ (uniform), there's a Latin framework of (n,n,2n).

\textit{Define LF an n by n array. For $(r_i,c_j)\in E$ $LF(i,j)=0$ else $LF(i,j)=1+n+((i+j)mod n)$. LF is a latin framework as the first two bullet points of the definition hold by construction and as $1+n\leq LF(i,j)\leq 2n$ LF will never equal a value in $1,...n$ and therefore the last two bullet points hold. The size is trivial. $\square$}

\textbf{Lemma}: Given latin framework LF(n,n,2n) for uniform tripartite graph G, we can extend the latin framework to have size (n,2n,2n).

\textit{First we have a few denotions: R(k) = the number of times k appears in L plus half $|e_k|$; $S_i=\{k|k \not\in LF(i,j) \forall j \cap (r_i,e_k)\not\in E\}$; $M=\{k|R(k)=r+s-t\}$. 
Whenever $R(k)\ge r+s-t$ for $1 \le k \le t$, L can be extended to (r,s+1,t) to give L' in which $R'(k)\ge r + s+1-t$ for all $1\le k \le t$}

\textbf{Lemma}: Latin framework (n,2n,2n) for grpah G, can be extended to (2n,2n,2n).

We can transpose the array and do the same as the previous lemma. $\square$

Given a tripartite graph G, if it is not uniform then no triangulation exists, else we apply above to produce a latin framework of size (2n,2n,2n) in polynomial time. This is a Latin square which can be completed iff G has a triangulation. The latin square problem has been reduced to the triangulating a tripartite graph problem. $\square$

\subsection{Triangulated Tripartite $\geq_p$ 3SAT}

\textit{What is 3SAT?} With a set of boolean variables $B$ and a collection of clauses $C$, with at most 3 literals (a literal is any $b \in B$ or its negation $\bar{b}$) in each, does a valid truth assignment exist that satisfies $C$?
		\begin{equation}
		        \phi (C,B) = \begin{cases}
		            \text{True if a truth assignment exists} \\
		            \text{False if a truth assignment does not exist}.
				\end{cases}
		\end{equation}
This decision problem is therefore an enforced limitation of SAT as defined in the subsection Computational Complexity an Introduction.

\textit{Proof:}

This reduction is a little trickier as we need to introduce the Holyer graph $H$ which dips a toe into topology as it is a torus.

Consider the graph $H_{3,p}$, a version of which can be seen in figure 2. Observe $H_{3,p}$ is a tripartite graph iff $p\equiv0 \text{ (mod }3)$, see the 3-colouring ($p$ refers to the 'height' and 'width').

$H_{3,p}$ has only two triangulations, termed a true and a false triangulation, we say $G=T$ if graph $G$ has a true triangulation and $G=F$ if it has a false triangulation. We connect graphs together by taking a set of vertices in $G_1$ and making them the 'same' as a set of vertices in $G_2$, sets are the same size.

\textbf{Lemma}: Connecting two $H_{3,p}$ by two A-patches then our triangulations of these graphs can be of the form $(T,T)$, $(T,F)$ or $(F,T)$. Then by removing the centre triangles from both graphs we get only the triangulations $(T,F)$ or $(F,T)$. If we expand this to $x$ $H_{3,p}$ we get only one false triangulation and the rest true.


Transformation process: (select p large enough to prevent patch overlap)
\begin{itemize}
\item For $b_i\in B$ create $H_{3,p}$ called $G_{b_i}$.
\item For all $c_j\in C$, for each literal $l_{i,j}$ $i\in [1,2,3]$ create $H_{3,p}$ called $G_{i,j}$.
\item For $b_i \in B$ connect an A-patch to each $G_{i,j}$ when $l_{i,j}=b_i$ or a B-patch to $G_{i,j}$ when $l_{i,j}=\neg b_i$. 
\item For each $c_i\in C$ connect an A-patch from $G_{1,i}$, $G_{2,i}$ and $G_{3,i}$ then delete the centre triangle. 
\item $G = \{G_{b_i}$ $|$ $b_i \in B\}\cup\{G_{i,j}$ $|$ $ c_j\in C\text{ and }i\in [1,..,3] \}$
\end{itemize}

Now we can take a 3SAT formula and convert it to the problem of triangulating a tripartite graph.

See figure 5 for an example. By the lemma; one of $l_{1,1}$, $l_{1,2}$ and $l_{1,3}$ must be a false triangulation and therefore the variable connexted to this false triangulation must be true, this satisfies the formula.

Triangulating a Tripartite Graph is hard. $\square$

\subsection{3SAT is NP-Complete}
%%%%% define clause

\textit{Proof:}

Given a truth assignment $t$ check each clause is satisfied, if all are satisfied return True else False, this algorithm is at most the length of $C$ multiplied by the length of $B$. $O(BC)$ is polynomial, a polynomial verifier exists. 

Given a SAT instance with the input sets of $B$ and $C$. $C$ is in conjunctive normal form (every clause set can be converted to an equivalent set in CNF form \cite{CNF}) such that $\forall c \in C$ and for some $b_1, ... ,b_n \in B$, $c = b_1 \lor b_2 \lor ... \lor b_n$. For each $c \in C$ with more than 3 literals we can transform these to a new set of clauses of length 3. 

For $c = b_1 \lor b_2 \lor ... \lor b_n$ we introduce a new literal: $a_1$ to give $b_1 \lor b_2 \lor a_1$, $\bar{b_1} \lor a_1$, $\bar{b_2} \lor a_1$ and $a_1 \lor b_3 \lor ... \lor b_n$. Then $a_1 \lor b_3 \lor ... \lor b_n$ becomes $b_3 \lor b_4 \lor a_2$, $\bar{b_3} \lor a_2$, $\bar{b_4} \lor a_2$ and $a_1 \lor a_2 \lor b_5 \lor ... \lor b_n$. This continues at most $n/2$ times to give $a_1 \lor ... \lor a_{n/2}$ or $a_1 \lor ... \lor a_{n/2} \lor b_n$ if n is odd. 

Because we can convert a clause larger than 3 into multiple clauses of at most 3 literals in linear time ($O(n/2 + n/4 + ...) = O(n)$) this means we can reduce SAT to 3SAT in polynomial time. 

As SAT is NP-complete by the Cook-Levin Theorem, this proves 3SAT is NP-Complete. $\square$

\section{Determining Uniqueness is Hard}

\textbf{Def$^n$:} The Sudoku Uniqueness problem is: Given a partially completed sudoku grid $S$ does only a single completion exist? 
		\begin{equation}
		        \Gamma (S) = \begin{cases}
		            \text{True if only a single completion exists} \\
		            \text{False if multiple completions or none exist}.
				\end{cases}
		\end{equation}

This is NP-hard (no polynomial verifier exists), NP-complete reduction exists.

It is hard to determine if a puzzle has a unique solution. 	 \textit{TO COMPLETE: FIND PAPER WITH PROOF}

\section{Backtracking}
The standard way to solve a $9 \times 9$ sudoku puzzle is by the backtracking algorithm. This is a brute force method with a few optimisations. One can expect to find this algorithm in a computer science course introduction to recursion, that is to say it is not a complex concept and while useful for the usual sizes, as soon as we increase to $16 \times 16$ this becomes infeesible. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Backtracking}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{ Backtracking}{grid}
    \For {row}
        \For {column}
            \If{grid(row,column) = 0}
                \State{try a value in this position}
                \State{Backtracking(grid with new value)}
                \If{successful}
                    \State{return grid}
                \Else:
                    \State{try another value}
	       \EndIf
                \If{no values left to try}
                    \State{return False}
		\EndIf
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFor
    \State{return grid}
\EndProcedure						
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Why does brute force not work for larger examples? It will work \textit{TO DO: PROVE ALG CORRECTNESS} but due to the complexity of the problem (point back to sudoku is hard chapter) it is infeesible.

			\State{choose successor at random}
			\State{$\Delta E$ = f(successor) - f(current)}
			\If{$\Delta E \geq 0$}
